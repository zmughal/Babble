=head1 NAME

Babble - EXPERIMENTAL Babel-like for perl

=head1 VERSION

0.009001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

If you're here for help dealing with changes in perl's signatures syntax,
look at L<App::sigfix>.

If you're here to try out Babble itself, you'll want to do

  use Babble::Filter qw(::CorePluginName External::Plugin::Name);

to have it rewrite your code on the fly, or

  perl -MBabble::Filter=::CorePluginName,External::Plugin::Name  \
    -0777 -pe babble lib/MyFile.pm >lib/MyFile.pmc

to rewrite for shipping.

Current core plugins are C<::CoreSignatures>, C<::State>, C<::DefinedOr>,
C<::PostfixDeref>, C<::SubstituteAndReturn> (C<s///r>), C<::Ellipsis>,
C<::PackageBlock>, C<::PackageVersion>, and C<::SKT> (which is a start on
rewriting L<Syntax::Keyword::Try>).  For an example of an external plugin,
see L<Method::Signatures::PP>.

Not for 'normal' use but still interesting, C<::Sigify> attempts to convert
simple @_ unrolls into signatures - best used on its own, followed by
applying L<App::sigfix> if you need the 5.22-5.26 oldsignatures style.
